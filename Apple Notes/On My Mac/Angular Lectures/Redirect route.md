- Path: ‘404’ it’s a component that we’ll navigated if search url wasn’t found
- Path ‘**’ it’s a symbol for every paths, it means that if we enter some name on url this path will catch it, **this path must be on the last one of Routes, so it won’t over executed on any paths we had** 
- **And with ‘redirectTo:’**  it’s an option to redirect to component we specified.
