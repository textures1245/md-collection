# Observable Introduction
#observable
 **(error reading attachment)**
A Object that we import from **third-party** like RxJS. Which implement in a way by follows the observable’s pattern

- **Observable** -> a third-party packaged object that we can use with to handle the **asynchronous tasks.**
 **(error reading attachment)**

- **Observer** -> Observable objects are registered, and other objects observe (**in Angular using the subscribe method**) them and take action when the observable object is acted on in some way **which executed in asynchronous** just like callback or promise. 
	- but with some differences. Promises execute once and then are done. Observable continue to be observed after the event occurs. Observable can also be cancelled but Promises cannot be cancelled
