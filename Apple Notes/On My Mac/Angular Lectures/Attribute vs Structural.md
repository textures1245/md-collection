 Attribute vs Structural
 **(error reading attachment)**
The different between these two is
- **Attribute only change/ affect the element. It’s just only change element’s look (like ngClass)**
- **Structural is change whole DOM. It’s mean that is not just only change element’s look but it change element’s body too (like *ngIf)**
