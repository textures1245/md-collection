	model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers.

1. `Physical Layer (1)` : Physical transmission of raw bits over a physical medium such as cables or wireless signals.
2. `Data Link Layer (2)`  :  This layer is responsible for framing raw bits into frames, detecting and correcting errors, and controlling access to the physical medium.
	- Logical Link Control (LLC)
	- Media Access Control (Mac)
- `Network Layer (Layer 3)`  :  network layer handles routing, forwarding, and addressing. It ensures that data packets are correctly
- `Transport Layer (Layer 4)`: This layer provides end-to-end communication and ensures reliable data transfer.
- `Session Layer (Layer 5)`: Established maintains, and terminates connections between applications on different devices. 
- `Presentation Layer (6)`: data translation, encryption, and compression. ensure that both applications can understand.
- `Application Layer (Layer 7)`: the topmost layer, interacts directly with end-user applications This layer includes various application-specific protocols like HTTP, SMTP, FTP, etc.

Why a Layered Model? 
	 Reduces complexity. 
	 Standardizes interfaces.
	 Facilitates modular engineering.
	 Ensures interoperable technology.
	 Accelerates evolution.
	 Simplifies learning and teaching.
