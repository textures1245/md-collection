Sure, here's a brief explanation of each:

1. **Cookies**: Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the web browser that are sent to the server with each request. They are often used for session management (like user logins), personalization (like user preferences), and tracking (like tracking user behavior). Cookies are sent with every HTTP request, so they can increase the amount of data being transferred, and they are limited in size (typically 4KB). They can be set to expire after a certain time period, after which they are deleted.
    
2. **Local Storage**: Local Storage is a part of the Web Storage API, and allows you to store data in a user's browser with no expiration date. This makes it useful for saving data across browser sessions. The data is saved across browser sessions and is only deleted if the user manually clears their browser storage, or if your web application does it programmatically. Local Storage is limited to about 5MB of data and is not sent with every HTTP request, which can make it a better choice for storing larger amounts of data that do not need to be sent to the server.
    
3. **Session Storage**: Session Storage is also a part of the Web Storage API, but unlike Local Storage, Session Storage data is deleted when the browser session ends (i.e., when the browser is closed). It's useful for storing data that should persist across multiple pages in a single browser session, but that doesn't need to be saved beyond that. Like Local Storage, Session Storage is not sent with every HTTP request and is limited to about 5MB of data.
    

In terms of their roles:

- **Cookies** are important for maintaining state in stateless HTTP requests, such as keeping a user logged in or tracking user activity.
- **Local Storage** is important for storing larger amounts of data client-side, such as user preferences or the state of a web application, that should persist even when the browser is closed and reopened.
- **Session Storage** is important for storing data that should persist across multiple pages in a single browser session, but that doesn't need to be saved beyond that, such as data for a single-session game or a multi-page form.

Remember that all these storage methods are accessible via JavaScript, and therefore are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Sensitive data should be stored securely and transmitted over secure connections.
