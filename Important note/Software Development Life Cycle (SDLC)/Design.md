1. **Requirements Determination:**
    - Study the existing system and gather details to find out what the requirements are, how it works, and where improvements should be made.
    - Conduct requirements anticipation, investigation, and specifications.
    - Use information gathering techniques, such as interviewing and prototyping.
    
2. **Information Requirements:**
    
    - Determine the information requirements of the organization.
    - Ensure the #SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document is complete, unambiguous, jargon-free, and specifies operational, tactical, and strategic information requirements.
    
3. **Feasibility Analysis:**
    
    - Perform feasibility analysis, including economic, technical, operational, behavioral, and schedule feasibility.
    - Evaluate the effectiveness of the candidate system using cost/benefit analysis.
    - Determine whether the solution can be supported by existing technology or not.
    - Ensure the management supports the proposed system and its working is feasible in the current organizational environment.
    
4. **System Architecture:**
    
    - Define the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for the system to satisfy specified requirements.
    - Create a well-organized and efficient structure that meets the intended purpose while considering factors like maintainability, and performance.
    
5. **Design Strategies:**
    
    - Identify the design strategies that will be used to fulfill the requirements.
    - Consider scalability, reliability, optimization, and flexibility in the design.
    
6. **Distributed System Components:**
    
    - Determine the need for load balancers, key-value stores, blob storage, databases, rate limiters, monitoring systems, distributed system messaging queue, distributed unique ID generator, distributed search, distributed logging services, and distributed task scheduler.
