### Technical Changed

- On **Image Pre-Processing (PPS) ,** we are now changed from **do own custome PPS** into **custome Liptonica config** for direct supporting Tesseract. when comes to test compatibility, you can achived these methods to see result
    
    1. **Blackbox Testing**: Implemented Test thorugth Go unit testing to see if testcases are valid or not. (unit tests are located at internal/model/slip/usecase/usecase_test.go)
        1. `Test_ITT_TDD_Slip_Context_Checker_BankResp_Mock` (Lagacy) → Mock bank responed data on testcase for testing
        2. `Test_Unit_TDD_Slip_Context_Threshold_Valid_Checker_BankResp_Mock_JSON` → Using Bank Respond as JSON from KBANK Slip Verification API for testcases
    2. **Whitebox Testing**: Understanding how the process works by manually producing results for each crucial process step. This involves:
        1. **Custom Image Preprocessing**: Manually applying custom preprocessing steps to images to understand their impact on OCR results.
        2. **Leptonica**: Configuring and using Leptonica for image processing to enhance compatibility with Tesseract.
        3. **Tesseract Configuration**: Fine-tuning Tesseract settings and parameters to optimize OCR performance and accuracy. This includes setting variables such as `tessedit_write_images` to output intermediate images for inspection and debugging.
- **Step to reproduce**
    
    1. Blackbox Testing (`Test_Unit_TDD_Slip_Context_Threshold_Valid_Checker_BankResp_Mock_JSON`)
        
        1. Generate Bank Respond JSON from `infrastructure/bank/data/dump_slip_data_test.go`
        2. On testcase loop-range, change testcase that you want to generate (you can define new testcase on `slip_to_export.go`)
        3. The JSON file would be located on `infrastructure/bank/data/json`
        4. On `Test_Unit_TDD_Slip_Context_Threshold_Valid_Checker_BankResp_Mock_JSON` there would config that you can define
            1. **csvPath**: This variable holds the path to a CSV file that contains test cases result history .
            2. **tcName**: This variable holds the name of the test case or the directory where the test case data is stored.
            3. **slipDat**: This variable holds the data for the test case, which is likely loaded from a predefined data source.
            4. **jsonDatPath**: This variable holds the path to a JSON file that contains test data.
            5. **ppc**: This variable holds a pointer to an `ImagePPConfig` struct, which contains configuration settings for image preprocessing
        5. Run implemented test to see the result
    2. White-box Testing
        
        1. If you want to involve custom PPS for testing, Using `pkg/util/image_test/image_test.go` for write Custom PPS out
        2. Process image with Leptonica from Tesseract CLI to see the impact
        
        ```bash
        **tesseract** input.jpg output --psm 3 -c tessedit_write_images=true
        ```
        
        c. Given image that already done preprocessed into Tesseract for see OCR output
        
        d. Re-attempt and change config to see the differenct results
        
- **How should you using these tests method to fullfill your requirement?**
    - **Blackbox Testing (P**erformance Test**)**
        - Testing OCR accuracy with a lot of testcases to see if fine-tune config test is overfit/underfit
        - Basic performance measurement
        - Testing if fine-tune configs are compatible with different enviroment (different e-slip)
    - **White-box Testing (Debug and Optimization)**
        - Understanding the internal workings and optimizing the fine-tune config
        - Detailed inspection and debugging to analytic root cause problem
