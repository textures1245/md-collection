- ## Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
	Based from [[App Requirement]] we had gathered. We can create document outlines for Application roadmap which can be describe as the following
	
	### **Introduction**:
	- Purpose: Describe the purpose of the SRS document and the intended audience.
	- Scope: Define the scope of the blogger website project and its key features.
	- Definitions and abbreviations: List any important terms or abbreviations used in the document.
	
	### **Overall Description**:
	- Product perspective: Provide an overview of the blogger website application and its context.
	- Product features: List the key features of the application, such as user registration, content creation, publishing, distribution, engagement, and discovery.
	- User characteristics: Describe the target users of the application (e.g., bloggers, writers, readers).
	- Operating environment: Specify the operating systems, browsers, and devices supported by the application.
	- Design and implementation constraints: Mention any known constraints or limitations (e.g., technology stack, third-party integrations).
	
	### **Specific Requirements**:
	- Functional requirements: Describe in detail the functional requirements for each feature or component of the application, such as user management, content management, content distribution, user engagement, content discovery, analytics, and additional features.
	- Non-functional requirements: Specify the non-functional requirements, such as usability, reliability, performance, security, maintainability, and portability.
	
	### **Interface Requirements**:
	- User interfaces: Describe the user interfaces, including the main screens, navigation, and interaction flow.
	- Hardware interfaces: Specify any hardware interfaces required (e.g., file upload, camera access).
	- Software interfaces: List any software interfaces or third-party integrations (e.g., social media APIs, analytics tools).
	- Communication interfaces: Define the communication interfaces, such as APIs or web services.
	
	### **Other Non-functional Requirements**:
	- Performance requirements: Specify any performance requirements, such as response times or throughput.
	- Security requirements: Define security requirements, such as authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
	- Software quality attributes: List any quality attributes the application should meet, such as scalability, extensibility, or maintainability.
	
	### **Other Requirements**:
	- Database requirements: Describe the database requirements, including the type of database, data models, and storage needs.
	- Operational and environmental requirements: Specify any operational or environmental requirements, such as deployment environments or hosting considerations.
	- Documentation requirements: List the documentation requirements, such as user manuals or developer guides.
