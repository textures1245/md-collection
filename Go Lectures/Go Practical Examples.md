[[Go Lectures]] #Go-Examples

1. **[[Basic and Resource Management]]**:
    - Write a program that reads a file and prints its contents to the console.
    - Implement a function that takes a slice of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers.
    - Create a program that simulates a simple bank account with deposit and withdrawal functions, ensuring thread safety using mutexes or channels.
2. **[[Go Channels, Goroutines, and Select]]**:
    - Implement a producer-consumer pattern using goroutines and channels, where one goroutine produces data, and another consumes it.
    - Write a program that concurrently fetches data from multiple URLs and combines the results.
    - Create a program that simulates a simple web crawler using goroutines and channels, where each goroutine fetches and processes a URL.
3. **Go Generic, Timeout, and Ahead-of-Time**:
    - Implement a generic function that takes a slice of any type and returns the sum or concatenation of its elements.
    - Write a program that simulates a client-server interaction, where the client sends a request and waits for a response with a timeout.
    - Create a program that uses Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation to generate optimized machine code for a specific function or algorithm.
4. **Error Handling, Pointers, and Concurrency**:
    - Write a function that reads data from a file and handles various errors that may occur during the process.
    - Implement a program that uses pointers to modify the values of variables passed to a function.
    - Create a program that uses goroutines and channels to perform a parallel calculation, such as finding the sum of elements in a large array.
5. **Timer & Ticker, HTTP Protocols, and Testing and Benchmarking**:
    - Write a program that uses a timer to periodically print a message to the console.
    - Implement a simple HTTP server that serves static files and handles different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
    - Create a test suite for a function or package you have written, and include benchmarks to measure its performance.
6. **Package & Module, Logger, and Package Method**:
    - Create a Go module with multiple packages, and write functions that demonstrate the usage of package-level variables and functions.
    - Implement a logging system for a simple application, using Go's built-in `log` package or a third-party logging library.
    - Write a package that provides utility functions for common tasks, such as string manipulation, file handling, or data processing.
