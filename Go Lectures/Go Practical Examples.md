[[Go Lectures]] #Go-Examples

1. **[[Basic and Resource Management]]**:
    - Write a program that reads a file and prints its contents to the console.
    - Implement a function that takes a slice of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers.
    - Create a program that simulates a simple bank account with deposit and withdrawal functions, ensuring thread safety using mutexes or channels.
2. **[[Go Channels, Goroutines, and Select]]**:
    - Implement a producer-consumer pattern using goroutines and channels, where one goroutine produces data, and another consumes it.
    - Write a program that concurrently fetches data from multiple URLs and combines the results.
    - Create a program that simulates a simple web crawler using goroutines and channels, where each goroutine fetches and processes a URL.
3. **[[Go Generic and Timeout]]**:
    - Implement a generic function and structs and achieved assign by the following 
		- given the generic function that takes a **slice** **of any type** and returns the **sum or concatenation** of its elements.
		- each time that had sum the elements, **keep track to last slice of its pointer elements.** And it can **print** **slice of elements** (convert pointers to original elements).
    - Write a program that simulates a client-server interaction, where the client sends a request and waits for a response with a timeout.

4. **[[Error Handling, Pointers, and Concurrency]]**:
    - Write a function that reads data from a file and handles various errors that may occur during the process.
    - Implement a program that uses pointers to modify the values of variables passed to a function.
    - Create a program that uses goroutines and channels to perform a parallel calculation, such as finding the sum of elements in a large array.
5. **[[Timer & Ticker, HTTP Protocols, and Testing and Benchmarking]]**:
    - Write a program that uses a timer to periodically print a message to the console.
    - Implement a simple HTTP server that serves static files and handles different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
    - Create a test suite for a function or package you have written, and include benchmarks to measure its performance.
6. ** [[Logger]]**:
    - Implement a custom logging library in Go with the following features:
		- **Log Levels**: Your logging library should support different log levels, such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL. Each log level should have an associated level of severity.
