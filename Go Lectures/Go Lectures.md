#TODO 

Here are the lists I should need to be learned next.
1. **Database Integration**: While not explicitly shown in the image, integrating with databases (both SQL and NoSQL) is a crucial part of building web application backends. You should learn about database drivers and libraries in Go, such as `database/sql`, `gorm`, or `mongo-driver`, depending on your database requirements.
2. **Authentication and Authorization**: Securing your web application and handling user authentication and authorization is an essential aspect of backend development. You might want to learn about JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth, or other authentication and authorization mechanisms in Go.
3. **Middleware and Routing**: While the image mentions "HTTP Protocols," you should also dive deeper into handling HTTP requests and responses, middleware, and routing using popular Go web frameworks like Gin, Echo, or Fiber.
4. **Caching**: Implementing caching mechanisms can significantly improve the performance and scalability of your web application. You should learn about in-memory caching libraries like `go-cache` or distributed caching solutions like Redis or Memcached.
5. **Logging and Monitoring**: While the image mentions "Logger," you should also explore more advanced logging and monitoring techniques, such as structured logging with libraries like `zap`, and integrating with monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana.
6. **Deployment and Containerization**: Understanding how to deploy and containerize your Go applications using tools like Docker and Kubernetes is essential for production-ready backend development.
7. **Concurrency and Synchronization**: While the image covers goroutines, channels, and select, you might want to reinforce your understanding of concurrency patterns, synchronization primitives (mutexes, wait groups, etc.), and best practices for concurrent programming in Go.
8. **Testing and Continuous Integration**: While "Testing and Benchmarking" is mentioned, you should also learn about different testing strategies (unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing), test coverage, and setting up continuous integration pipelines for your Go projects.
9. **Error Handling and Logging**: Although "Error Handling" is listed, you should dive deeper into idiomatic error handling practices in Go, including creating custom error types, using error wrapping libraries like `pkg/errors`, and implementing structured logging for errors.
10. **Package Management and Dependency Management**: Understanding how to manage packages, dependencies, and versioning using tools like `go mod` and `go get` is essential for building maintainable and scalable Go applications.
