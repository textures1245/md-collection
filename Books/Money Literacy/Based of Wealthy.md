| The wrong is people usually think that **they need to Make More money to become Wealthy (Outside-in)** | But actually **They must give importance to `Speed Wisely` first** because human have ability to take **Move their expenses to match the income.** So we should fixed the root problem first and start with this we can easier control out money to get **Wealthy** |
